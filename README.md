# arrow-intro
A brief introduction to the oc-accel workflow.

# Requirements:
This notebook assumes you are running in the OpenCAPI course VM.
Otherwise, here are some of the requirements you need to run it.
There is a [repository with scripts that installs all of the requirements](https://github.com/joosthooz/fletcher-oc-accel-installscripts), so you could also choose to adapt those to your system.

- Python 3
- jupyter-notebook 6.2.0+
- oc-accel & ocse (and their requirements)
